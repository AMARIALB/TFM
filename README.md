# Review on pectoral muscle segmentation algorithms in mammography and a subsequent novel deep learning algorithm development

This study investigates pectoral muscle segmentation in mammograms, essential for early breast cancer detection. It begins with a comprehensive review of existing segmentation techniques based on machine learning, followed by the development of an innovative algorithm. This algorithm, an enhanced U-Net model with ResNet50 architecture implemented in PyTorch, was applied to a public database for validation. Key findings include the algorithm's continuous improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) across 150 training epochs, indicating effective learning and increasing generalization. However, challenges in achieving optimal Dice coefficient values highlight areas for future improvement. The work contributes to medical imaging by integrating advanced machine learning techniques, aiming to enhance the accuracy and reliability of breast cancer diagnostic tools.
